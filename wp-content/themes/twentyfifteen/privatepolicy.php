<h6>Our Commitment To Privacy</h6>

<p>You privacy is important to us. Hands and Feet of Jesus Ministry is committed to respecting the privacy of online visitors. Our website is not set up to track, collect or distribute personal information not entered by visitors. Our site logs do generate certain kinds of non-identifying site usage data, such as the number of hits and visits to our site. This information is used for internal purposes only by technical support staff to provide better service to the public.</p>
<h6>Credit Card Information</h6>
<p>
Hands and Feet of Jesus Ministry has contracted the services of a banking partner to process credit card donations submitted online. Our banking partner’s secured server encrypts your credit card information so that it may be safely transmitted over the Web. Your credit card information will not be released by Hands and Feet of Jesus Ministry or its banking partner to any other party.
What Information Do We Collect? How Do We Use It?</p>
<p>
We are strongly committed to protecting the privacy of our donors. If you make a donation, we will request contact information (name, e-mail, phone number and address) to facilitate your gift. During the year we may send you information about HAF programs, events or fundraising appeals. Under no circumstances do we sell, trade or rent your personal information to others. We do not participate in telemarketing or direct mail.</p>
<p>
In cases where donations are specifically made in honor or memory of an individual, we send an acknowledgment letter to the honoree or honoree’s family. With the permission of the donor, the donor’s name is included. Should the honoree or honoree’s family wish to send a personal acknowledgment, we will provide the donor’s address, but only upon request and with the permission of the donor. The gift amount is never included.</p>
<p>
Unless you specify that your gift should be “anonymous” or otherwise request that your name not be listed, we list the names of donors who give $10,000 and above in our biennial report to acknowledge your generosity publicly.</p>
<h6>
To review your personal information, to opt out of future mailings, or to inquire about our privacy policy, please contact Sandro Lemberg. HAF may release personal information under the following circumstances:</h6>
<p> Where release is required by law or regulation or is requested by a government agency;</p>
   <p> Where our records indicate that a person may be engaged in fraudulent activity or other deceptive practices that a government agency should be made aware of;</p>
